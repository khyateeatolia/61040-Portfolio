## 1. Ten Domains

- Elderly digital autonomy – Many older people struggle with the complex online systems and web tools of popular websites, such as Amazon, Uber, and even email, as well as various apps aiding in tracking medicines or vitals that can be useful to them.  
- Digital grief and memorialization – Managing scattered digital lives like email accounts, backups and drives, and social media accounts of loved ones after their death.  
- Civic data storytelling – Government datasets are often dense, inaccessible, or underutilized. A lot of important information that can be useful in activism, research, or campaigning is difficult to uncover due to the way these datasets are structured.  
- College student resources – A lot of the clubs, Greek life houses, jobs and volunteer opportunities still rely solely on physical flyering across campus and mass emailing to get their events and opportunities publicized.  
- Dating app fatigue and safety – A lot of youth are hesitant to get on dating apps or have had unsatisfactory experiences on these apps. I wonder if there is a way to address swipe burnout, ghosting, and the emotional toll that comes with these apps.  
- Neurodiverse productivity tools – The existing productivity tools assume a “one size fits all” approach, but neurodivergent people may need flexible layouts, calming interfaces, and different modes of task management.  
- Tenant landlord transparency – College students and early grads often enter leases or subleases with little knowledge about a landlord’s past behavior, building issues, or fairness. Tools here could increase transparency with maintenance records, tenant reviews, and clear explanations of lease terms to prevent exploitation.  
- Micro volunteering – With the rise of hyper individualism, we have somehow lost “the village”. Yet, people, and most often, the youth, are willing to help in their community if it doesn’t take too long and is not a long term commitment. How can we arrange this?  
- Eating well – Many college students struggle with eating a balanced meal due to limited money, time, or cooking skills. A good tool could help plan affordable, nutritious meals tailored to campus dining hall options, local grocery stores, and dietary restrictions.  
- Sustainable fashion – Many students buy cheap, fast fashion that wears out quickly. College dumpsters are left overflowing with high quality, usable articles of clothing and accessories that end up wasted or in the landfill, leading to unsustainable fashion.

## 2. My Three Selected Domains

**Domain A: Campus resource navigation and sharing**  
As a student, I’ve seen peers miss mental health workshops, tutoring sessions, and school scholarship deadlines simply because the information was scattered across emails, portals, and flyers. I have also seen someone rip apart a flyer and take it with them to ensure that they “do not forget the details.” I have been on the flyering side, where I have spent papers and time trying to reach everyone across campus. The information is scattered and unorganized.  

**Domain B: Sustainable fashion**  
In my university’s dorm, fashion sharing is common but unorganized. It usually happens between friends or if there is an ask on a public chat forum. Usually, students buy cheap clothes, then discard them soon after. Trends and fashion change, and a lot of the older clothes keep piling up, unworn.  

**Domain C: Dating apps and online dating**  
I’ve heard friends say dating apps left them drained. Conversations abruptly end with no explanation after investing time and emotional energy in them. They are unable to meet their match and are increasingly frustrated after spending time on these apps that lead to no results.

## 3. Problems Within Each Domain

**Domain A: Campus resource navigation and sharing**  
1. Missed deadlines for scholarships, registrations, club events, campus events, or mental health services.  
2. Information overload — students don’t know which emails are critical versus optional, and a lot of the emails from clubs and offices alike go unopened.  
3. The need for constant rechecking to ensure that their flyers have not been removed or damaged requires time and resources from already overworked students.  

**Domain B: Sustainable fashion swapping for students**  
1. Clothing goes unused or discarded because students don’t know how to easily pass it on.  
2. Existing swap groups rely on large membership and informal reach, making them easy to miss.  
3. Health and safety concerns (condition of garments) may deter students from swapping with or buying from strangers.  

**Domain C: Anti ghosting dating app**  
1. Users are ghosted without closure, leading to self doubt and emotional stress.  
2. Ghosting isn’t discouraged by default UX, making it the path of least resistance.  
3. Lack of tools for graceful disengagement means conversations stall indefinitely or lead to multiple surface level conversations.

## 4. Selected Problems with Justification

**Problem A: Missed deadlines for critical resources and missed events**  
Unreliable awareness of deadlines for scholarships, fellowships, and support services is widespread and harmful. Fixing this can be impactful and provide immediate help. The other problems are valid, but they are too reliant on social networks or have complicated UX.  

**Problem B: Clothing is unused because students don’t know how to pass it on**  
This problem combines environmental waste and financial pressure. It’s visible and solvable with a simple platform that we can code. Peer group chaos is hard to regulate and monitor well, and health concerns can be addressed at later stages.  

**Problem C: Emotional harm from ghosting**  
Ghosting is pervasive and emotionally damaging and can be addressable via respectful software design. It’s more tractable than fundamentally redesigning dating culture or creating mental health guardrails built into our dating apps.

## 5. Stakeholders

**A. Missed opportunities due to a lack of centralized information**  
- Students – They miss out on important information like courses, opportunities, jobs, or clubs that they could have utilized.  
- Academic advisors and staff – They face inefficiency and frustration when students miss critical deadlines regarding the opportunities that the school offers.  
- University communications team – Their work seems ineffective when students ignore messages or announcements.  

**B. Clothing unused due to a lack of sharing know how**  
- Student donors – They feel wasteful and overburdened when good clothes sit unused, and have no easy way to share them.  
- Student receivers – They miss affordable clothing and accessories options that could reduce financial strain.  
- Campus sustainability office – They lose chances to promote reuse and reduce waste on campus.  

**C. Ghosting in dating**  
- Dating app users (ghostees) – They feel hurt and confused when conversations suddenly end without closure.  
- Dating app providers – They risk losing users and reputation when ghosting becomes a common experience.  
- Mental health support providers – They must help students who struggle with the emotional stress of ghosting.
